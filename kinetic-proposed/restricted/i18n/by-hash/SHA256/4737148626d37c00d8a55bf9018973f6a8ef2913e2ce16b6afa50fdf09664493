 The SmartLink modem daemon is the application part of the driver for
 recent modems produced by Smart Link Ltd.
 .
 This package replaces (along with hardware access drivers) the old driver
 generation (2.7.x) which consisted of kernel modules only.
 .
 It needs a kernel driver to access the hardware. This can be either recent
 ALSA (shipped with a newer kernel (>=2.6.4) with ALSA support and snd-
 intel8x0m module) which is sufficient for basic operation and
 data/Internet connection, or the SmartLink kernel driver which is provided
 by separate packages which you can build using the source from the sl-
 modem-dkms package.
