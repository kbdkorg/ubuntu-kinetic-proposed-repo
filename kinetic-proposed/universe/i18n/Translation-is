 go-toml v2 is a Go library for the TOML format. It supports TOML (Tom's
 Obvious, Minimal Language) version v1.0.0.
 .
 Eiginleikar
 .
 Stdlib behavior As much as possible, this library is designed to behave
 similarly as the standard library's encoding/json.
 .
 Performance While go-toml favors usability, it is written with performance
 in mind. Most operations should not be shockingly slow.
 .
 Strict mode Decoder can be set to "strict mode", which makes it error when
 some parts of the TOML document was not prevent in the target structure.
 This is a great way to check for typos.
 .
 Contextualized errors When decoding errors occur, go-toml returns
 DecodeError), which contains a human readable contextualized version of
 the error.
 .
 Local date and time support TOML supports native local date/times. It
 allows to represent a given date, time, or date-time without relation to a
 timezone or offset. To support this use-case, go-toml provides LocalDate,
 LocalTime, and LocalDateTime. Those types can be transformed to and from
 time.Time, making them convenient yet unambiguous structures for their
 respective TOML representation.

Package: libperfmark-java
Description-md5: 614bce00248d8da9dba068ee7ebb035f
Description-is: High Performance Tracing Library for Java
 Low-overhead, manually-instrumented, tracing library for Java. Users can
 add the tracing function calls to their code to see how long each part
 takes.
 .
 Eiginleikar
 .
  * Very Low Overhead: When enabled, tracing a function call adds about 70ns.
    Tracing is done in a lock-free, wait-free, thread local buffer, which
    avoids interfering with your latency-sensitive code.
 .
  * Dynamically Enabled: PerfMark can be enabled or disabled at runtime. When
    disabled, PerfMark has zero overhead, taking advantage of the JIT compiler
    to remove the tracing.
 .
  * Inter-thread Communication: Existing profilers have difficulty expressing
    which thread wakes up and executes work on another thread. PerfMark allows
    users to express this relationship explicitly, making for a clear picture
    of how code flows.
 .
  * Small Library Size: The PerfMark tracing API is only 5 KB in size, and has
    minimal dependencies making it easy to include in other projects. If no
    backend for recording the trace is present, the library safely disables
    itself.
 .
  * Multiple Java Versions: The PerfMark API supports Java 6, making it easy to
    include on older or constrained environments. Additionally, PerfMark
    includes optimized backends for Java 6, Java 7, and Java 9. Each of these
    backends is automatically loaded at runtime (if possible) and uses advanced
    JVM features for maximum speed.
 .
  * Chrome Trace Viewer Integration: PerfMark can export to the Chrome Trace
    Event Format, making it easy to view in your Web Browser.

Package: python3-locust
Description-md5: 911e441f2a6793c9ab945f6dce380f04
Description-is: Developer friendly load testing framework
 Locust is an easy to use, scriptable and scalable performance testing
 tool. You define the behaviour of your users in regular Python code,
 instead of using a clunky UI or domain specific language. This makes
 Locust infinitely expandable and very developer friendly.
 .
 Eiginleikar
 .
  * Write user test scenarios in plain-old Python -- If you want your users to
    loop, perform some conditional behaviour or do some calculations, you just
    use the regular programming constructs provided by Python. Locust runs every
    user inside its own greenlet (a lightweight process/coroutine). This enables
    you to write your tests like normal (blocking) Python code instead of having
    to use callbacks or some other mechanism. Because your scenarios are “just
    python” you can use your regular IDE, and version control your tests as
    regular code (as opposed to some other tools that use XML or binary
    formats).
  * Distributed & Scalable - supports hundreds of thousands of users -- Locust
    makes it easy to run load tests distributed over multiple machines. It is
    event-based (using gevent), which makes it possible for a single process to
    handle many thousands concurrent users. While there may be other tools that
    are capable of doing more requests per second on a given hardware, the low
    overhead of each Locust user makes it very suitable for testing highly
    concurrent workloads.
  * Web-based UI -- Locust has a user friendly web interface that shows the
    progress of your test in real-time. You can even change the load while the
    test is running. It can also be run without the UI, making it easy to use
    for CI/CD testing.
  * Can test any system -- Even though Locust primarily works with web
    sites/services, it can be used to test almost any system or protocol. Just
    write a client for what you want to test, or explore some created by the
    community.


Package: python3-pyipmi
Description-md5: d01606fd9a99f9fd5ee7cd972addcf81
Description-is: Pure Python IPMI library
 The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a set of computer
 interface specifications for an autonomous computer subsystem that
 provides management and monitoring capabilities independently of the host
 system’s CPU, firmware (BIOS or UEFI) and operating system. The python-
 ipmi library provides an application programming interface (API) for using
 IPMI protocol within the Python environment. This library supports IPMI
 version 2.0 as described in the IPMI standard.
 .
 There are two ways to communicate with a server using IPMI interface:

     Protocol (RMCP) packet datagrams
  2. Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB) is an I2C-based bus

Package: twine
Description-md5: 85dc96f3482fa75a4f41796dff720d43
Description-is: utility for interacting with PyPI
 Twine is a tool for uploading distributions (in the Python meaning) to
 PyPi.
 .
 Why should twine be used over the traditional approach?
 .
 The biggest reason to use twine is that python setup.py upload uploads
 files over plaintext. This means anytime you use it you expose your
 username and password to a MITM attack. Twine uses only verified TLS to
 upload to PyPI protecting your credentials from theft.
 .
 Secondly it allows you to precreate your distribution files. python
 setup.py upload only allows you to upload something that you’ve created in
 the same command invocation. This means that you cannot test the exact
 file you’re going to upload to PyPI to ensure that it works before
 uploading it.
 .
 Finally it allows you to pre-sign your files and pass the .asc files into
 the command line invocation (twine upload twine-1.0.1.tar.gz
 twine-1.0.1.tar.gz.asc). This enables you to be assured that you’re typing
 your gpg passphrase into gpg itself and not anything else since you will
 be the one directly executing gpg --detach-sign -a <filename>.
 .
 Eiginleikar
 .
  - Verified HTTPS Connections
  - Uploading doesn’t require executing setup.py
  - Uploading files that have already been created, allowing testing of
    distributions before release
  - Supports uploading any packaging format (including wheels).

Package: vim-snipmate
Description-md5: b32d99279c72a1dbfce80f206863cd65
Description-is: Vim script that implements some of TextMate's snippets features.
 SnipMate.vim aims to be an unobtrusive, concise vim script that implements
 some of TextMate's snippets features in Vim. A snippet is a piece of
 often-typed text that you can insert into your document using a trigger
 word followed by a <tab>.
 .
 For instance, in a C file using the default installation of snipMate.vim,
 if you type "for<tab>" in insert mode, it will expand a typical for loop
 in C:
 .
 for (i = 0; i < count; i++) {
 .

 .
 To go to the next item in the loop, simply <tab> over to it; if there is
 repeated code, such as the "i" variable in this example, you can simply
 start typing once it's highlighted and all the matches specified in the
 snippet will be updated.
 .
 snipMate.vim has the following features among others:
 .
  - The syntax of snippets is very similar to TextMate's, allowing easy
    conversion.
  - The position of the snippet is kept transparently (i.e., it does not use
    marks/placeholders inserted into the buffer), allowing you to escape out
    of an incomplete snippet, something particularly useful in Vim.
  - Variables in snippets are updated as-you-type.
  - Snippets can have multiple matches.
  - Snippets can be out of order. For instance, in a do...while loop, the
    condition can be added before the code.
