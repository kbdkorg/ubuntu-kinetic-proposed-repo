 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting initial
 values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories and mail spool or
 all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.
