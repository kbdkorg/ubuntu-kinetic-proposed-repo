Description-zh_TW: 進階 Bash-Scripting 手冊
 An in-depth exploration of the art of shell scripting.
 .
 This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming,
 but progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of
 instruction ... all the while sneaking in little snippets of UNIX(R)
 wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and a
 reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques. The
 exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader
 participation, under the premise that the only way to really learn
 scripting is to write scripts.
 .
 本書適合課堂使用，作為程式設計概念的介紹。

Package: afio
Description-md5: ca88467cccd23b8f150ff01185566a6c
Description-zh_TW: 壓縮/封存檔處理程式
 Afio manipulates groups of files, copying them within or between
 filesystems and an afio archive.
 .
 Afio archives are portable as they contain only ASCII-formatted header
 information. Afio makes cpio-format archives.  Afio deals somewhat
 gracefully with input data corruption.  Afio supports multi-volume
 archives during interactive operation.  Afio can make compressed archives
 that are much safer than compressed tar or cpio archives.
 .
 Afio is best used as an `archive engine' in a backup script.
