Description-bg: Наръчник по Bash скриптинг за напреднали
 An in-depth exploration of the art of shell scripting.
 .
 This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming,
 but progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of
 instruction ... all the while sneaking in little snippets of UNIX(R)
 wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and a
 reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques. The
 exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader
 participation, under the premise that the only way to really learn
 scripting is to write scripts.
 .
 This book is suitable for classroom use as a general introduction to
 programming concepts.
