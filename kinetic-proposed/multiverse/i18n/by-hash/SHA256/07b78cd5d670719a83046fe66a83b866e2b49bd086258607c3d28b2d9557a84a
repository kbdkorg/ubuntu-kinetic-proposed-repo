Description-oc: Lo guida de l'escript bash avançat
 Una exploracion en prigondor de l'art de l'escript shell.
 .
 This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming,
 but progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of
 instruction ... all the while sneaking in little snippets of UNIX(R)
 wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and a
 reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques. The
 exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader
 participation, under the premise that the only way to really learn
 scripting is to write scripts.
 .
 This book is suitable for classroom use as a general introduction to
 programming concepts.

Package: afio
Description-md5: ca88467cccd23b8f150ff01185566a6c
Description-oc: programa de manipulacion de fichièrs d'archiu
 Afio manipulates groups of files, copying them within or between
 filesystems and an afio archive.
 .
 Afio archives are portable as they contain only ASCII-formatted header
 information. Afio makes cpio-format archives.  Afio deals somewhat
 gracefully with input data corruption.  Afio supports multi-volume
 archives during interactive operation.  Afio can make compressed archives
 that are much safer than compressed tar or cpio archives.
 .
 Afio is best used as an `archive engine' in a backup script.

Package: anbox
Description-md5: 2cf24869b7c28429da5987f75987875f
Description-oc: Android en bóstia
 Anbox is a container-based approach to boot a full Android system on a
 regular GNU/Linux system.
 .
 In other words: Anbox will let you run Android on your Linux system
 without the slowness of virtualization.
 .
 Anbox uses Linux namespaces (user, pid, uts, net, mount, ipc) to run a
 full Android system in a container and provide Android applications on any
 GNU/Linux-based platform.
 .
 The Android inside the container has no direct access to any hardware. All
 hardware access is going through the anbox daemon on the host. It reuses
 what Android implemented within the QEMU-based emulator for OpenGL ES
 accelerated rendering. The Android system inside the container uses
 different pipes to communicate with the host system and sends all hardware
 access commands through these.
 .
 This package needs Android kernel modules and rootfs image, see
 /usr/share/doc/anbox/README.Debian for information.
