Description-en_AU: The Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide
 An in-depth exploration of the art of shell scripting.
 .
 This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming,
 but progresses rapidly towards an intermediate/advanced level of
 instruction ... all the while sneaking in little snippets of UNIX(R)
 wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and a
 reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques. The
 exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader
 participation, under the premise that the only way to really learn
 scripting is to write scripts.
 .
 This book is suitable for classroom use as a general introduction to
 programming concepts.

Package: afio
Description-md5: ca88467cccd23b8f150ff01185566a6c
Description-en_AU: archive file manipulation program
 Afio manipulates groups of files, copying them within or between
 filesystems and an afio archive.
 .
 Afio archives are portable as they contain only ASCII-formatted header
 information. Afio makes cpio-format archives.  Afio deals somewhat
 gracefully with input data corruption.  Afio supports multi-volume
 archives during interactive operation.  Afio can make compressed archives
 that are much safer than compressed tar or cpio archives.
 .
 Afio is best used as an `archive engine' in a backup script.

 created. Thus, this book describe a NON-STANDARD version of Common Lisp
 which is similar to, but is *NOT*, ANSI Common Lisp.
 .
 For reference on ANSI Common Lisp, use the Debian package "hyperspec".
 This book is included in Debian because, while it does differ from the
 ANSI standard, it has more details than the "hyperspec" about the design
 and usage of Lisp.

Description-en_AU: Multiple alignment of nucleic acid and protein sequences (graphical interface)
 This package offers a GUI interface for the Clustal multiple sequence
 alignment program. It provides an integrated environment for performing
 multiple sequence- and profile-alignments to analyse the results. The
 sequence alignment is displayed in a window on the screen. A versatile
 colouring scheme has been incorporated to highlight conserved features in
 the alignment. For professional presentations, one should use the texshade
 LaTeX package or boxshade.
 .
 The pull-down menus at the top of the window allow you to select all the
 options required for traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment.
 You can cut-and-paste sequences to change the order of the alignment; you
 can select a subset of sequences to be aligned; you can select a sub-range
 of the alignment to be realigned and inserted back into the original
 alignment.
 .
 An alignment quality analysis can be performed and low-scoring segments or
 exceptional residues can be highlighted.

Description-en_AU: client to donate unused CPU cycles to distributed.net
 Donate your extra CPU cycles to a worthy cause!
 .
 distributed.net started in 1997 as a project whose purpose was to win a
 series of contests sponsored by RSA Data Security Inc., to crack their RC5
 encryption by brute-force methods. These contests were meant to show
 governments of nations such as the United States, who limit exports or use
 of cryptography, that the standards allowed are too weak for general use.
 .
 Since this time, distributed.net's focus has changed from solely cracking
 RSA's RC5 and DES projects to working on more diverse distributed
 computing problems.
 .
 The ongoing projects are RC5-72 and Optimal Golomb Rulers (28-mark), the
 latter of which has practical applications in science. There are also a
 number of other projects which are either periodic or upcoming. You may
 choose which project you wish to participate in.
 .
 Installing this package will allow unused CPU cycles on your computer to
 contribute to cracking the code. There should be no noticeable slowdown of
 your system, since the client runs niced, and only uses CPU time when your
 computer would otherwise be idle.

Package: dynare-matlab
Description-md5: 90e8fcabb135fcf60e09f0be51774946
Description-en_AU: MATLAB support for Dynare
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic
 models, in particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and
 overlapping generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include
 those relying on the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form
 their expectations about the future in a way consistent with the model.
 But Dynare is also able to handle models where expectations are formed
 differently: on one extreme, models where agents perfectly anticipate the
 future; on the other extreme, models where agents have limited rationality
 or imperfect knowledge of the state of the economy and, hence, form their
 expectations through a learning process. In terms of types of agents,
 models solved by Dynare can incorporate consumers, productive firms,
 governments, monetary authorities, investors and financial intermediaries.
 Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by including several distinct
 classes of agents in each of the aforementioned agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these
 models. It is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration
 of the model parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters
 given a dataset. In practice, the user will write a text file containing
 the list of model variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables
 together, the computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or
 numerical outputs.
 .
 This package is only useful to users having MATLAB installed on their
 machine. It contains the source of the MEX files and will recompile them
 using the existing MATLAB installation.

 BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular
 sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured
 phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It
 can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a
 framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a
 single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that
 each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. Included
 is a simple to use user-interface program for setting up standard analyses
 and a suit of programs for analysing the results.

 RHVoice uses statistical parametric synthesis. It relies on existing open
 source speech technologies (mainly HTS and related software).

 Voices are built from recordings of natural speech. They have small
 footprints, because only statistical models are stored on users'
 computers. And though the voices lack the naturalness of the synthesizers
 which generate speech by combining segments of the recordings themselves,
 they are still very intelligible and resemble the speakers who recorded
 the source material.

 Esperanto and Georgian. In theory, it is possible to implement support for
 other languages, if all the necessary resources can be found or created.

 set for three different voice qualities defined by their vocal effort, low
 effort ("soft voice"), medium effort ("normal or modal voice"), and high
 effort ("loud voice").
 .
 This diphone database was recorded jointly by the Institute of Phonetics
 at Saarland University and by the Language Technology Department at DFKI,

Description-en_AU: find issues in MP3 files and help to solve them
 MP3 Diags is a GUI-based application that allows end-users to identify
 issues with their MP3 files, fix some of the issues and make other
 changes, like adding track information. It also allows user to "look
 inside" an MP3 file.
 .
 Unlike some programs that are designed to deal with a single topic (like
 fixing VBR headers or adding cover art), MP3 Diags is a one stop solution
 that identifies more than 50 different issues in MP3 files and provides
 the means to fix many of them.
 .
 Some of the more important issues that are found:
 .
  * Broken tags / headers / audio.
  * Duplicate tags / headers.
  * Incorrect placement of tags / headers (ID3V2, ID3V1, LAME, Xing, etc).
  * Low quality audio.
  * Missing VBR header.
  * Missing track info / cover art.
  * Broken track info / cover art.
  * Missing normalisation data.
  * Character encoding issues (for languages other than English).
 .
 Some of the fixes and changes that MP3 Diags can do:
 .
  * Adding / fixing track info, including album cover; information can be
    retrieved from several sources: Internet, clipboard, file name, local
    files, and (obviously) keyboard.
  * Correcting files that show incorrect song duration.
  * Correcting files in which the player cannot seek correctly.
  * Converting characters for non-English names.
  * Adding composer name to the artist field, for players that don't handle
    the composer field.
  * Renaming files based on their fields.
  * Changing word case for track info.

 contains several real-world data sets, the ability to simulate outbreak
 data, and to visualize the results of the monitoring in a temporal,
 spatial or spatio-temporal fashion. A recent overview of the available
 monitoring procedures is given by Salmon et al. (2016)
 <doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i10>.
 .
 For the retrospective analysis of epidemic spread, the package provides
 three endemic-epidemic modeling frameworks with tools for visualization,
 likelihood inference, and simulation. hhh4() estimates models for
 (multivariate) count time series following Paul and Held (2011)
 <doi:10.1002/sim.4177> and Meyer and Held (2014) <doi:10.1214/14-AOAS743>.
 twinSIR() models the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) event history
 of a fixed population, e.g, epidemics across farms or networks, as a
 multivariate point process as proposed by Höhle (2009)
 <doi:10.1002/bimj.200900050>. twinstim() estimates self-exciting point
 process models for a spatio-temporal point pattern of infective events,
 e.g., time-stamped geo-referenced surveillance data, as proposed by Meyer
 et al. (2012) <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01684.x>. A recent overview of
 the implemented space-time modeling frameworks for epidemic phenomena is
 given by Meyer et al. (2017) <doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i11>.

 document formats (most of which share a common object numbering system for
 locating content), including plain text, HTML, XHTML, XML, EPUB,
 OpenDocument text (ODF:ODT), LaTeX, PDF files, and populate an SQL
 database with objects (roughly paragraph-sized chunks) so searches may be
 performed and matches returned with that degree of granularity: your
 search criteria is met by these documents and at these locations within
 each document. Object numbering is particularly suitable for "published"
 works (finalized texts as opposed to works that are frequently changed or
 updated) for which it provides a fixed means of reference of content.
 Document outputs also share semantic meta-data provided.
 .
 SiSU also provides concordance files, document content certificates and
 manifests of generated output.
 .
 man pages, and interactive help are provided.

Package: tome
Description-md5: 9efcf47839037501aa7357051f1287d3
Description-en_AU: single-player text-based roguelike dungeon simulation game
 Tome, short for Troubles of Middle Earth, is a single-player, text-based,
 dungeon simulation derived from the game angband, which in turn is derived
 from the older game Moria, which was in turn based on Rogue. It is often
 described as a "roguelike" game because the look and feel of the game is
 still quite similar to Rogue.
 .
 In tome, the  player may choose from a number of races and classes when
 creating a character, and then "run" that character over a period of days,
 weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by defeating Morgoth, who
 lurks somewhere in  the depths of the dungeon.
 .
 The ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough to
 defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so, you will
 receive the exalted status of "winner" and your character may retire.
 .
 The first main difference from Angband a new player to ToME will need to
 be aware of is that it has implemented a skills based system where instead
 of the  adventurer automatically improving in their abilities as they
 become more experienced, they get 5 skill points to spend on their
 character's abilities and can therefore customise what type of character
 they play. See the skills help file for details
 .
 The second major difference is that the main dungeon from Angband has been
 split  into 4 "dungeons", each of which cover a different portion of the
 dungeon's  levels. Note that not all of the places are actually "dungeons"
 - some are caves, forests, etc.
 .
 The third main difference between Vanilla Angband and ToME is the
 difference  in character classes and races, as well as a very different
 magic system. ToME also offers the player the ability to undertake a
 series of  quests. It is not required for any adventurer to undertake  the
 fixed  quests, but they can result in some nice rewards.
 .
 Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He was
 banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, "god" of J.R.R. Tolkien's world)
 at the end of the First Age and thus never appears in The Lord of the
 Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does figure into those tales,
 was the most powerful of his servants. Read Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion'
 for more on the legends of Middle-Earth. Angband is a reference to
 Morgoth's "prison of iron."

 sites usually provide a site-wide server.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing just local
 newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you can configure trn to
 access it.  In this case you will also need to install an appropriate
 'inews' package for local posting.
 .
 This is a separate package from trn because trn 4.0 has enough substantial
 changes in its default behaviour (for instance, the group selector is new
 in 4.0) that some users prefer to stay with an older version of trn.
